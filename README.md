# Docs Markdown to XML Conversion

**Gems**
require 'rubygems'
require 'json'
require 'map'
require 'yaml'
require 'chronic'
require 'nokogiri'
require 'redcarpet'
require 'rouge'

    **Notes**: I am still trimming out code/libs that were used in my cbu... most of it has been removed.
               XML output is added to content folder, but I will migrate that to the "out" folder soon
